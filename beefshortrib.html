            <p class="ribs_desc">The ingredients for this dish are listed below. Short ribs are one of my all-time favorite dishes to make. They are fairly cheap, full of tender fat and really bring out a heartly flavor when slow cooked in red wine and beef stock.</p>

                <li>Pre-heat oven to 325F.</li>
                <li>Take your deep roasting pan, place on stovetop and add olive oil. Season the short ribs with salt, pepper, paprika, garlic & onion powder. Cook for 10-15 minutes to brown each side.</li>
                <li>Take your garlic head & cut in half. Place the head and push down into the pan. Add the tomato puree and heat for a few minutes to cook it out. Pour in your red wine to deglaze the pan, bringing to a boil and cook for 10-15 minutes until the liquid is reduced.</li>
                <li>Cover the roasting pan with foil and cook in the preheated oven for 3-4hrs, basting every hour until the meat is tender and falling off the bone. </li>
                <li>Once the time is up, take out the short ribs, and squeeze the garlic cloves out of there skin and pass through a sieve. If the sauce is still too thin, you can reduce it more by cooking for additional 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Garnish the short ribs in chopped parsely and serve.</li>
