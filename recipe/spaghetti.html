                <li>Making spaghetti is all in the preperation and letting your flavors build. You want to season you meat with all the seasonings listed above.</li>
                <li>Next you will need to get your pan above medium heat and add some olive oil.</li>
                <li>Take your pot and add water, heating up to boil. Add in some salt & olive oil to the water as well.</li>
                <li>Drop that seasoned meat into the pan and cook until brown.</li> 
                <li>Once the meat is cooked through, add the pasta sauce to the meat and cover with a lid to let simmer on low for about 15 min. </li>
                <li>Every few minutes you want to stir the meaty sauce and I like to add in some additional Italian seasoning to build up the flavor.</li>
                <li>Add in the small diced tomatoes and cover again. Once the noodles are cooked, drain the water and slowly add them to the pasta sauce.</li>
                <li>Finally, add in the butter to the spaghetti and stir. Let rest for a few mintues before you dig in and enjoy!</li>
